View a model64 model (such as generated by mkmodel) by appending it to a rom,
and load that rom.

`make` builds `model64viewer64.z64` (don't run that rom, it would crash as the model is not there)

`injectmodel.py` creates `model64viewer64_romhacked.z64`, with the model appended

if the `assert len(rom_bytes) <= ROMHACKED_OFFSET` assert fails, make ROMHACKED_OFFSET bigger than the size of the `model64viewer64.z64` rom.
/!\ keep ROMHACKED_OFFSET values in sync between model64viewer64.c and injectmodel.py
